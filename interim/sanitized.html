    <h4>Case No 1</h4>
    <p>A 60 year old man walked into the Neurology Clinic and the physician paid particular attention to his gait. The patient raised his feet unnecessarily high and brought them to the ground in a stamping manner. On questioning, the patient said that he
        was 4 finding it increasingly difficult to walk and was starting to use a stick, especially when he went out for walks in the dark. The physician asked the patient to stand with his toes and heels together and close his eyes. The patient immediately
        started to sway. On further examination, the patient was found to have loss of muscle-joint sense of both legs and was unable to detect any feeling of vibration when a vibrating tuning fork was placed on the medial malleolus of either of legs.
        No other sensory or motor losses were noticed. Questions:</p>
    What is the site of lesion? Which sensations are carried by the concerned sensory tract? Name the test the doctor performed? Answers The site of lesion – fibers of dorsal column is the fasciculus gracilus and fasciculus cuneatus is effected by Tabes dorsalis.
    It is a neurological symptom of tertiary syphilis that affects degeneration of dorsal nerve root. Sensations carried by the dorsal tract can be memorized by the pneumonic PSVT Propioception Somatic localization (two point discrimination) Vibration
    Touch (fine) 5 Rhomberg’s sign is positive in the patient of Tabes dorsalis. This is a sign of sensory ataxia. On removing the visual cues the person falls. In cerebellar ataxia whether eyes are open or closed the person falls.
    <h4>Case No 2</h4>
    A 21 year old soldier returned from the war after receiving a gunshot wound in his spinal column. On examination, you note that he has weakness of left lower extremity. In addition he has loss of pain and temperature perception on the right side from
    about the level of his navel downward, vibration joint position sense and discriminatory function are reduced in the left leg touch is normal. Questions What is the anatomico pathological diagnosis? What is the name given to this type of syndrome?
    Why was the sensation of touch preserved in this patient? Answers Lesion in left side of the spinal cord at T10 Brown Sequard Syndrome or Hemisection of spinal cord Left side touch is preserved because anterior-spinothalamic carrying touch on left
    side crosses to right side. Right side touch is preserved because posterior column (dorsal column) carries touch which is preserved.
    <h4>Case No 3</h4>
    A 46 year old man had progressive weakness in all the four limbs, for 8 weeks. He also had difficulty in taking food. His speech is slurred. Examination of motor system revealed 6 a) Power grade III in all four limbs b) Deep reflexes are sluggish c) Hypotonia
    d) Twitching of muscle was present e) Plantar reflex-flexor bilaterally Questions What type of lesion the man is suffering from Upper motor neuron Lesion (UMNL) or Lower motor neuron Lesion ( LMNL)? Why do you think so? Which condition can lead to
    this type of disorder? Lower motor Neuron Lesion ( LMNL) There is hypotonia, weakness of muscles, reflexes are sluggish. Plantar reflex is flexor bilaterally or down going i.e. Babinski’s sign is negative. These are signs of ( LMNL) Cisternal Puncture
    Poliomyelitis Demyelinating disease
    <h4>Case No 4</h4>
    7 Mr. A Gurung is a 70 year old male who fell in the bathroom one morning. He was found to lie on the floor, awake and alert, but was unable to move his right arm and leg. He has been hypertensive (220/110 mm of Hg) but well controlled with medication
    (150/90 mm of Hg). He states that recently he has had some minimal difficulty maintaining his balance. Neurological Examination Motor system- Nearly complete paralysis of right arm, right leg could be elevated only slightly. Strength on the left side
    seemed normal and left leg could be raised about 45 degrees. Few flickers of motion were noticed in the biceps and triceps. Reflexes- Monosynaptic reflexes (MSRs) are brisk (+) from the right biceps, triceps, quadriceps and gastrocnemius. MSRs are
    normal on the left. Babinski’s sign is positive on the right side. Questions What type of lesion the man is suffering from UMNL/LMNL ? Why do you think so? What is the possible site of lesion? What might be the cause? Upper Motor Neuron Lesion (UMNL)
    Babinski’s sign is positive Exaggeration of reflexes The site of lesion is in the left side of Internal capsule Thrombosis/ Ischemia/Atherosclerosis of lenticulo-striate branch of Middle cerebral artery Upper motor neuron (UMN) Paralysis Lower motor
    neuron (LMN) Paralysis The neuron from the brain to anterior horn cell are lesioned e.g. pyramidal tract The spinal or cranial nerves are lesioned Hypertonic or Spastic paralysis due to release of inhibitory higher control Flaccid paralysis No atrophy
    3. Disuse atrophy Brisk hyperactive reflexes due to increase in gamma motor discharge Absence of reflexes Babinski’s sign positive 5. Babinski’s sign not elicited 8 Stoking the outer edges of the sole of the foot with firm tactile stimulus produces
    first an upward movement i.e. dorsiflexion of the great toe and fanning out abduction of the small toes. This is due to contraction of extensor hallucis longus. This is flexor withdrawal response. It will remain positive through out the life if once
    positive. He can neither run fast nor travel long distances. Causes Deep sleep Infants below one year of age Pyramidal tract lesions Cheynes Stokes respiration due to hypoxia
    <h4>Case No 5</h4>
    A 37 year old man visited his physician because he had noticed clumsiness of his right arm. The symptoms had started six months previously and were getting worse. He also noticed that his right arm. The symptoms had started six months previously and were
    getting worse. He also noticed that his right hand had a tremor when he attempted fine movements or tried to insert a key into the lock. When he walked he noticed that now and again he tended to reel to the right and had a staggering gait. Neurological
    examination revealed a) When asked to touch his nose with his right index finger, the right hand displayed tremor and the finger tended to overshoot the target. b) Hypotonia of muscles Questions 9 Which part of the nervous system is affected? Explain
    the cause of signs and symptoms of this disease? Answers Cerebellum (right cerebellar lobe- as there is double crossing of fibers and cerebellar lesion affects the same side) Hypotonia because of loss of facilitatory effect of neocerebellum Intentional
    tremors are seen when fine movements are attempted because of alternate contractions of agonistic and antagonistic muscles. Cerebellum helps in making movement smooth , coordinated and accurate in rate, range and force. In cerebellar disease an entire
    movement can’t be directed by a single motor command. Stagggering gaitas subject face difficulty in maintaining balance, he moves in a zigzag fashion, has a tendency to fall on the same side as the affected side of lesion Dysmetria.Cerebellum is needed
    for execution of activity, due to dysmetria there is loss of target perception . Past pointing 10 Rebound phenomenon
    <h4>Case No 6</h4>
    A 65 year old man presented in the medicine OPD with complaints of tremor. He has a stooped posture, festinating gait and loss of associated movements, masked face and slurred voice. On examination muscle tone showed cogwheel rigidity Questions: Name
    the disease the patient is suffering from ? What are the sites of lesion? Mention the changes in the neurotransmitter in this disease. Answers Parkinson disease Basal ganglia Decrease in Dopamine/ Increase in Acetylcholine Reduction in choline acetyl
    transferase in nucleus basalis 11 12
    <h4>Case No 7</h4>
    A 68 years old man was brought to a neurology clinic with symptoms of tremors of hand. He suffered from profound weakness of muscles, gets easily fatigued, more so in the evening. It was noticed that his eyelids were drooping and the infrequently blinked
    his eyes. The patient tended to speak in a low, faint voice. Questions What do you think is the possible diagnosis? What is the cause and mention the changes in neurotransmitters. How it can be treated? Answers Myasthenia gravis Formation of circulating
    antibodies to nicotine Acetylcholine receptors (Nm). It is a rare but autoimmune disease. Neurotransmitter acetylcholine is destroyed in synaptic cleft by acetylcholinesterase. This produces a miniature end plate potential (MEPP). The subject suffers
    from profound weakness of muscles and he gets fatigued easily It can be treated by administration of Neostigmine or other effective anticholinesterase inhibitors that help increase concentration of acetycholine in the cleft by preventing its destruction.

    <h4>Case No 8</h4>
    A 25 year old man awake one morning and noted that the left side of his face seemed weak. On looking into a mirror he noted that he could not retract the left corner of his mouth as well as the right. He also noted that he could no longer close his left
    eye completely or smiles with the left side of his face. Neurological examination revealed no abnormality except for the following: a) At rest the left side of the face dropped and the left palpebral fissure was wider than the right b) The left side
    of his forehead did not wrinkle when he tried raising his eyebrows c) When he attempted to show his teeth his mouth pulled to the right d) Results of testing for sensations of pain, temperature and touch of the face were normal e) Taste was absent
    on the left side of the tongue f) Strips of filter paper were placed in the conjuctival sac, the one on the right became moist within a few minutes and the left side remained dry. Questions What is the location of the lesion? Why was taste involved?
    Why was their decreased lacrimation? What is the name of this clinical entity? Answers Genu of facial nerve Taste is involved because branch of facial nerve is cut that conveys taste sensation from anterior 2/3 rd of tongue Lacrimation is decreased
    because of damage to greater petrosal nerve Bell’s palsy 14
    <h4>Case No 9</h4>
    A 40 year old man has come to a STD clinic with sign and symptoms of tertiary syphilis Examination revealed: a) His pupils are small and fixed bilaterally b) Light reflex is lost bilaterally c) Accommodation reflex is intact bilaterally 15 Questions What
    is the name of this condition? What is the site of lesion? Explain why the accommodation reflex is intact and light reflex is lost? Answers ARP -Argyll Robertson pupil (ARP-Accomodation Reflex Present, Light reflex absent ) Pretectal nucleus of midbrain
    3. Pathway of Light reflex Light information Optic nerve Optic tract Superior colliculi or Pretectal nucleus Via colliculonuclear fibers III nerve, ciliaryganglia , sphincter pupillae The accommodation reflex When an individual looks at a near object
    the following are manifested: 1) Contraction of ciliary muscle via III nerve, as a result anterior curvature of lens increases. 2) Constriction of pupil due to contraction of sphincter pupillae 3) Convergence of visual axis due to contraction of medial
    rectus muscle 16 Pathway of Accommodation Reflex Visual information Via visual pathway Primary visual area of cortex, area 17 Frontal eye fields, area 8 Via corticonuclear fibers III rd nerve, EdingerWestphal nucleus Ciliary muscles, sphincter pupillae
    and medial rectus Note to remember corticonuclear and colliculonuclear. Accomodation reflex comes from relay in cortex (corticonunclear), is involved in reading. The light reflex involves the midbrain (colliculonuclear). The accomodation involves
    the conciousness and is absent in lower animals. A dog has light reflex but cannot read! Problem Based Learning : Endocrine System 17
    <h4>Case No 1</h4>
    A 30 year old woman noted the onset of amenorrhea one year ago. In the past 6 months she noted that she became tired very easily; could not tolerate stress and cold weather, she had also lost weight. Physical examination revealed a dull apathetic thin
    woman with low blood pressure, slow pulse rate. a) What is the site of primary lesion? b) What structures are affected by the lesion? c) Which hormones are affected in this patient? Answer a) Anterior pituitary b) Thyroid gland, adrenal cortex, ovaries
    18 c) i) Gonadotropic hormones (FSH, LH)-deficiency causes amenorrhea ii) Lack of TSH- hence patient becomes tired, loss of weight is observed, cannot tolerate cold weather, decrease in blood pressure and slow pulse rate iii) Lack of ACTH-there is
    intolerance of stress 19
    <h4>Case No :2</h4>
    20 A 40 year old man noticed a frequent need to increase the size of his shoe for the past four months. His friends also told him about the changes in his facial features. His forehead is slanted forward and lower jaw is protruding forward and tongue
    enlarged. X-ray of his ankle and wrist showed an increase in soft tissue thickness. Biochemical test showed an increase in fasting blood sugar level. Questions What is the endocrine disorder the man is suffering from? What might be the cause of this
    disorder? Why is there an increase in the fasting blood sugar level? Answers Acromegaly : due to excessive secretion of growth hormones after the fusion of epiphysis i) Pituitary tumor-release of excess of Growth hormone (GH) ii) Functional tumour
    of hypothalamus-causes release of GHRH (growth releasing hormone) iii) Hypothalamic lesion Growth hormone is a diabetogenic hormone. It decreases peripheral uptake of glucose. Hence fasting blood sugar levels increase in acromegaly. 21
    <h4>Case No. 3</h4>
    A 45 year old woman presented with the complaints of easy fatigability and lack of appetite for past one month. On examination it was found that her skin is dry, thickened, and yellowish with a puffy face and course hair. She also complained of recent
    loss of her eyebrow. Her voice was husky. Neurological examination showed delayed reflexes. Biochemical examination showed high blood cholesterol level. Questions What endocrine disorders the patient is suffering from? 22 Why her voice is husky and
    the skin is dry and thickened? What might be the probable causes of this disorder? Answers Myxoedema (hypothyroidism) Due to laryngeal oedema which also causes recurrent laryngeal nerve compression, the voice becomes husky Accumulation of Hyaluronic
    acid/ chondroitin sulphate beneath the skin makes it dry and thickened A) Iodine deficiency- Endemic goiter B) Hashimoto’sthyroiditis C) Thyroidectomy D) Any radiation injury E) Pituitary or Hypothalamic failure (Decrease in TSH or decrease in TRH)
    23
    <h4>Case No. 4</h4>
    24 A 30 year old woman complained of excessive sweating, increased appetite and loss of weight for past one month. On examination she had tachycardia with high systolic blood pressure. Her thyroid gland showed diffuse symmetrical enlargement. She had
    exophthalmos with fine tremors in her outstretched fingers. Biochemical test showed increased plasma T3 and T4 and slight decrease in plasma TSH level Questions: What is the probable diagnosis? Why this patient had exophthalmos? Why are there as increase
    plasma T3 and T4 level and a slight decrease in plasma TSH level? Answers Hyperthyroidism (Peri-graves disease) Due to accumulation of chondroitin sulphate and hyaluronic acid in extra-ocular muscles of eye, accumulation of water occurs and eyes bulge,
    leading toproptosis and an increase in vertical diameter in which sclera is visible over the iris (Exopthalmos) Hyperfunctioning of thyroid gland causes increase in T3 and T4 levels; These have negative feedback at level of pituitary thereby decreasing
    levels of TSH -primary hyperthyroidism. In secondary hyperthyroidism the TSH levels are high because of a tumor of pituitary, that causes hyperthyroidism. Serum TSH levels are used to differentiate between primary and secondary hyperthyroidism 25
    <h4>Case No 5</h4>
    A 35 year old lady complaint of weakness, fatigue and weight loss for past one month. On examination, BP of 82/58 mm of Hg. Hyperpigmented areas are seen on her palm and buccal mucosae. On examination the patient was found to have bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy
    and high serum calcium level. Lymph node biopsy showed non- caseating granulomas. Questions: What is the probable diagnosis? Why is the patient having hyperpigmentation? Why is her BP low? Answers 26 Addison’s disease Due to decrease in aldosterone
    and glucocorticoids, there is an Increase in ACTH due to decrease in negative feedback. ACTH has β MSH like activity that causes hyperpigmentation. POMC is Pre-Opio-Melano-Cortin that breaks down to opiod, melanin(MSH) and cortin for providing ACTH.
    Melanin stimulating hormone causes the hyperpigmentation. Lack of aldosterone, leads to decrease renal tubular sodium reabsorption, consequently loss of sodium, chloride and water occurs in urine. The ECF volume decreases and that’s why her Blood
    pressure is low
    <h4>Case No 6</h4>
    A 35 year old has undergone radical thyroidectomy for papillary carcinoma of thyroid gland. Her recovery was uneventful till the second postoperative day, when suddenly she developed seizures and her voice was choked. The doctors on duty could demonstrate
    carpopedal spasm. The patient recovered only after an i.v injection of calcium gluconate. 27 Questions What was the problem in this case? What are biochemical tests done to confirm the diagnosis? Why does the patient develop seizures and carpopedal
    spasm? Answers During radical thyroidectomy, parathyroid gland has also been removed. This leads to decrease in Parathormone and decrease in calcium. Serum Calcium level (normal 9-11mg%) Other tests are-  Chvostek’s sign: Facial tics on tapping facial
    nerve at pre-auricular area  Trousseau’s sign: Carpopedal spasm (Figure 6) on tying BP cuff at 100 mm Hg  Erb’s sign: Policeman tip hand  Laryngeal stridor: Life threatening condition , may require tracheostomy The patient develops seizures and
    carpopedal spasm because of Hypokalemia. Calcium has a stabilizing effect on cell membrane of excitable tissue. Hypocalcemia exerts a net excitatory effect on nerve cell and muscles. 28
    <h4>Case No 7</h4>
    A 50 year old man presented with complaints of polyuria, polydipsia and loss of weight in spite of increased appetite for past two months. Biochemical examination showed high fasting and postprandial blood sugar level. Questions What is the probable diagnosis?
    What are the causes? What are the complications in this type of disease? Answer Diabetes mellitus (Type I) Causes are those that damage β cell which are 29  Autoimmunity  Viral infection  Genetic factors Complications are-  Atheroscleosis  Microangiopathy
     Diabetes nephropathy  Ketoacidosis  Neuropathy  Retinopathy
    <h4>Case No 8</h4>
    A 6 year old boy has no testicle present in the right side of his scrotum. On careful palpation a deep firm ovoid structure could be felt above the medial part of the inguinal ligament. Questions What is the probable diagnosis? What causes descent of
    testes? What is the effect of undescended testis? What is the benefit of descent of testes to scrotum? Answer Cryptorchidism a) Gubernaculum b) MIS (Mullerian inhibitory substance) c) Testosterone The descent of testes is necessary for normal spermatogenesis.
    Therefore effect of undescended testes is sterility. Benefit of descent of testis to scrotum- There is air circulation in scrotum. Hence temperature of testes is maintained or little less than body temperature Counter current blood flow causes  Maintenance
    of concentration of testosterone  Temperature regulation 30
    <h4>Case No 9</h4>
    A 25 year old lady was brought by her husband to the OPD with complaints of dizziness, nausea and vomiting. She gave a history of having missed her last menstrual period. On examination her BP was 130/90 mm Hg. Rest of the systems were normal. Questions
    What is your probable diagnosis? What are the tests to be done to confirm the diagnosis? 31 Why she missed her last menstrual period? What is the role of ovary at this time? Answers Woman is pregnant HCG in urine Syncytiotrophoblast in developing
    zygote secretes HCG which maintains corpus luteum and prevents its degeneration. Hence high levels of progesterone are secreted from corpus luteum. Menstruation proper or break through bleeding occurs due to fall in levels of progesterone and estrogen.
    Ovary becomes corpus luteum which maintains high estrogen and progestrone level for maintenance of pregnancy.
    <h4>Case No 10</h4>
    A married woman living with her husband reports to the doctor for amenorrhea on May 20, 2002. She had her last menstrual period beginning April 1 2002 and ending April 4, 2002. She reports of regular 30 day cycle. Questions What is the first impression
    of the doctor? Which day do you think the woman has ovulated? Which test the doctor shall recommend for his/her diagnosis to be confirmed? What is the physiological basis of the test? Answer Woman is pregnant April 16, 2002 Presence of HCG in urine
    proves diagnosis Antigen-Antibody reaction (Agglutination) Antibodies are produced against HCG in rabbit. Sheep RBC’s are labeled with HCG These two and urine from woman are mixed. 32 If agglutination does not occur, there is no pregnancy But if agglutination
    occurs woman is pregnant. OBJECTIVE STRUCTURED CLINICAL EXAMINATION GENERAL EXAMINATION LYMPHNODE S 1.Explain the test procedure and make the subject comfortable 2.Inspect for visible lymphadenopathy(Macleod’s) 3.Palpate one side at a time using the
    finger of each hand in turn (Macleod’s) 4.Compare with the nodes on the contralateral sides (Macleod’s) 5.Assess site ,size, consistency, tenderness; determine whether the node is fixed to a) surrounding structures or deep structures b)Skin 6 .Measure
    the main nodes(Macleod’s) CERVICALNODES 33 Examine the cervical and axillary nodes with the subject sitting(Macleod’s) From behind, examine the ubmental,submandibular,preauricular,tonsillar,supra clavicularanddeepcervicalnodesintheanteriortriangleo
    ftheneck(Macleod’s) Palpate for the scalene nodes by placing your index finger between the sternocleidomastoid muscle and clavicle. Ask the subject to tilt his head to the same side and press firmly down towards the first rib(Macleod’s) From the front
    of the subject, palpate the posterior triangles ,up the back of the neck and the posterior auricular and occipitalnodes(Macleod’s) AXILLARYNODE S From the subject’s front or side, palpate the right axilla with your left hand and viceverse. Gently
    place your fingertips into the apex of the axilla and then draw them downwards, 34 Feeling the medial ,anterior and posterior axillary walls in turn. Keep your nails short to avoid causing discomfort. (Macleod’s) CYANOSIS Explain the test procedure
    and make the subject comfortable See the bluish discoloration of skin and or mucous membrane. It is commonly seen at sites were skin is thin for e.g. mucous membrane of undersurface of tongue, lips , earlobes , nail beds and tip of nose. For central
    cyanosis look at lips and tongue. For peripheral cyanosis look at hands , ears or feets. PALLOR Explain the test procedure and make him comfortable Look for pallor in skin , mucous membrane of mouth , conjunctiva and creases of palm of hands ICTERUS
    Explain test procedure and make him comfortable Look for jaundice in a bright day light in upper conjunctiva and sclera by everting the both upper lids while subjects looks downwards Do not comment on jaundice at night as torch light gives yellow
    reflection In emergency situation torch light covered with blue cellophane paper can be used to examine the jaundice at night 35 CLUBBING Explain test procedure and make him comfortable Bring the subjects finger at your eye level and look tangentially
    look at the onychodermal angle (angle formed between the nail bed and the adjacent skin fold if it 180 degree or more (angle is lost) clubbing is present Look for the fluctuation of the nail bed by giving gentle pressure over the base of the nail
    by tip of right index finger while holding the subjects finger say middle finger between the thumb and index finger of left hand and supporting the pulp of the finger over the pulp of the right thumb Alternative method schamroths window test approximate
    the nails of two fingers preferably the thumb of both hands and look for the normal diamond shape gap between the two nails and the proximal nail folds in clubbing this diamond shape gap is either reduced or obliterated. CADIOVASCULAR SYSTEM PULSE
    Stand on the subjects right side and explain the test procedure Place the subjects forearm in the semipronated position with the wrist slightly flexed Place pads of 03 middle fingers over the right radial artery Count the radial pulse for full 01
    minutes only when it has resume normal rate. Asses rate rhythm character, vol. and condition of vessel wall. Palpate both radial pulses simultaneously to assess volume difference Palpate femoral and radial pulse simultaneously noting delay between
    two and any difference in volume between them. 36 APEX BEAT Stand On subjects right side And explain the test procedure Expose the chest above waist completely and keep female patients chest covered with sheet. Inspect the precordium with patient
    sitting at 450&lt; and shoulder’s horizontal Ensure the hands are warms Locate apex beat by lying finger’s on chest parallel to ribs spaces. If cannot fell roll on his left side Mark the Mid – Clavicular line and locate the fifth ICS by proper counting
    of the space definesthe cardiac impulse area and feels for the apex beats 37 Auscultate the chest For the hard sounds of the subject provided Stand on the right side of the subject and explain the test procedure. Check for the normal functioning of
    stethoscope and place the earpieces comfortably into the ears along direction ears. Expose the subject chest completely Place the diaphragm stethoscope on any one of the heart artery (Mitral, Tricuspid, Pulmonary &amp; Aortic) after proper counting
    of intercostal spaces. Palpation of the carotid artery provide a systolic time reference 1st Heart sound proceeds the carotid pulsation and 2nd heart sound follows the carotid pulsation Listen to one heart sound for several minutes before coming to
    any conclusion JUGULAR VENOUS PRESSURE (JVP) Stand on the right side of the subject and explain the procedure Position the subject so that he is reclining supine comfortably until the wave form is clearly visible (start at 45 degree) Rest the patient
    head on pillow to ensure the neck muscles are relaxed Look across the neck from the right side of the patient Identify the jugular vein pulsations If not certain use the Abdomino-jugular reflex or occlusion to confirm it is the JVP The JVP is the
    vertical height in centimeters between the top of the venous pulsations and the sternal angle Identify the timing and form of pulsation and note any abnormality 38 BLOOD PRESSURE Check the zero reading on the mercury manometer Rest the patient for
    5 mins Use either arm unless one arm is known to record a higher pressure , if that is the case use this arm With the patient seated/lying down support his arm comfortably at about heart level ensuring no tight clothing constricts the upper arm ,you
    can measure over thin clothing as it makes no difference to the result Wrap un-inflated cuff of sphygmomanometer firmly around the bear upper arm 2.5-5 cm above the elbow joint Palpate the brachial pulse Inflate the cuff until the pulse is impalpable
    note the pressure on the manometer this is a rough estimate of systolic pressure (palpatory method) Inflate the cuff another 30mmHg and listen through the diaphragm of the stethoscope placed over the brachial artery Deflate the cuff slowly (2-3mmHg)
    until you hear a regular tapping sound (phase I Krotokoff sound).record the reading to the nearest 2mmHg.this is the systolic pressure 10.Continue to deflate the cuff slowly until the sounds disappear Record the pressure at which the sounds completely
    disappear as the diastolic pressure (phaseV).occasionally muffled sounds persist (phase IV) and do not disappear in which case the point of muffling is best guide to the diastolic pressure PERCUSSION OF BORDER’S OF HEART 39 LEFT BORDER Stand on the
    right side of the subject and explain the test procedure Subject is percussed in the 4th and 5th ICS (inter costal space) in the mid-axillary region and then medially towards the left border of the heart Resonant note of lung becomes dull Normally
    it is along the apex beat) RIGHT BORDER Stand on the right side of the subject and explain the test procedure Subject is percussed anteriorly in the midclavicular line on the right side until the liver dullness Then percuss one space high from midclavicular
    line medially to the sternal border Normally right border is retrosternal UPPER BORDER Stand on the right side of the subject and explain the test procedure Subject is percussed in 2nd and 3rd ICS in parasternal line (b/w midclavicular and lateral
    sternal line) Normally resonant note in 2nd space and dull in 3rd space RESPIRATORY SYSTEM TRACHEAE With the patient looking directly forward look for any deviation Feel for the tracheae by putting the second and fourth finger’s of the examining hand
    on each edge of the sternal notch and use the third finger to assess whether the tracheae is central/deviated to one side. Avoid heavy handedness in this situation it is uncomfortable for the patient if the examiner is rough 40 A slight deviation
    of tracheae to the right may be found in healthy people EXPANSION OF CHEST Explain the procedure and relax the subject Assess expansion of the upper lobes by observing the clavicle from behind during tidal breathing 3 . To assess the expansion of
    the lower lobes place your hands firmly on the chest wall and extend your finger’s around the sides of the patient’s chest your thumb’s should almost meet in the midline and hover just of the chest, so that they move with respiration 4.Ask the patient
    to take a deep breath your thumb’s should move symmetrically atleast 5cms apart TACTILE VOCAL RESONANCE Stand on the right side of patient Check the proper functioning of stethoscope and place the ear piece comfortably into the ear along direction
    of ears Ask the patient to repeat a phrase such as “ninety nine” Assess the quality and amplitude of vocal resonances Compare each point examined on one side with corresponding point on other side RULES OF PERCUSSION Place the palm of your left hand
    on chest with your finger’s slightly separated (Macleod’s) 41 Press the middle finger of your left hand firmly against chest aligned with the underlying rib’s over area to be percussed (Macleod’s) Strike the center of middle phalanx of your left middle
    finger with the tip of your middle finger using a loose swinging movement of wrist and not forearm (Macleod’s) Percussion finger is bent so that it at right angle and it strikes the other finger perpendicular(Macleod’s) Remove the percussing finger
    quickly so thatthe note generated is not dampened (Macleod’s) Percuss the lung apices by placing the palmer surface of your left middle finger across the anterior of the trapezius muscle, overlapping the supraclavicular fossa and percussing downwards(Macleod’s)
    Percuss the clavicle directly over medial third as percussing laterally is dull over shoulder muscles(Macleod’s) To percuss the uppermost chest ask the patient to fold the arm’s across the front of chest there by moving the scapula laterally (Macleod’s)
    Do not percuss near the midline as produces dull note from solid structures map out abnormal areas by percussing from resonant to dull(Macleod’s) TACTILE VOCAL FREMITUS Stand on the right side of the subject and keep your hand on the chest wall Ask
    the subject to repeat a phrase such as “ninetynine” Feel for the distinct vibrations Flat of hand including fingertips are used as it is far more sensitive Compare each point examined one side with corresponding point on other side 42 RESPIRATORY
    RATE Stand on the right side of the subject and explain the test procedure Count respiration for full one minute starting when their attention is directed elsewhere It is conveniently done when the patient thinks you are still counting on pulse CENTRAL
    NERVOUS SYSTEM CRANIAL NERVES HYPOGLOSSAL NERVE XII Explain the test procedure to the subject Ask the subject to open the mouth look at the tongue at rest for wasting , fasciculation’s or involuntary movements Ask the subject to protrude out his as
    far as possible Look for deviation or involuntary movements (Macleod’s) Ask the patient to move tongue from side to side Test power by asking the patient to press the tongue against the inside of each cheek in turn while you press from outside with
    your finger (Macleod’s) Assess speech by asking the patient to say YELLOW LORRY (Macleod’s) Assess swallowing with water swallowing movement (Macleod’s) 43 THE ACCESSORY NERVE (XI) Explain the test procedure to the subject and give proper instructions
    Face the patient and inspect the sternocledomastoid muscle for wasting/hypertrophy palpate them to assess their bulk (Macleod’s) Ask the subject to flex the head while applying passive resistance from below Ask the subject to rotate chin to right
    while applying passive resistance from left side Repeat the whole procedure by applying passive resistance from the right side now ask the subject to rotate his chin to left FOR TRAPEZIUS MUSCLE Explain the test procedure to the subject and give proper

    then reach out to touch your finger tip held just within the subject arm’s reach Ask the subject to repeat the movement between nose and target finger as quickly as possible Make the test more sensitive by changing the position of your target finger
    timing is crucial move your finger just as the subjects finger is about to leave his nose HEEL SHIN TEST Make the subject comfortably lie supine in the bed 58 Explain the test procedure Ask the subject to raise one leg and place the heel on the opposite
    knee and then slide the heel up and down the shin between knee and ankle. RAPID ALTERNATING MOVEMENTS Make the subject comfortably seated in a chair Explain the test procedure Demonstrate the act of repeatedly patting the palm of one hand with the

    with his feet’s together with eyes open and then with eyes closed(Hutchison’s) Subjects with sensory ataxia will sway/even fall when eyes are closed but will stand normally with eyes open(Hutchison’s) Subject with cerebellar ataxia will sway to both
    sides , weather eyes open or closed(Hutchison’s) EXAMINATION OF ABDOMEN EXAMINATION OF LIVER Explain the test procedure and make the subject comfortable Start in the right iliac fossa by placing flat hand on the abdomen with fingers pointing upwards
    and sensing fingers (index and middle)lateral to the rectus muscle , so that your finger tips lie parallel to rectus sheath.(Macleod’s) 61 Keep your hand stationary and ask the subject to breathe in deeply through the mouth. feel for the edge as it
    descends on inspiration Move your hand progressively up the abdomen 1cm at a time between each breathe until you reach the costal margin or detect the liver edge If you feel the liver edge liver may be enlarged or displaced downwards by hyper inflated
    lungs If you feel the liver edge then describe its size , surface , edge , consistency , tenderness , whether pulsatile or any bruit heard EXAMINATION OF SPLEEN Explain the test procedure and make the subject comfortable Start from the umbilicus and
    by keeping your hand stationary ask the subject to breathe deeply through mouth feel for the splenic edge as it descends on inspiration Move your hand diagonally upwards towards the left hypochondrium 1cm at a time between each breathe. Feel the costal
    margin along its length as the position of the spleen tip is variable If you cannot feel the splenic edge ask the subject to roll towards you and on to his right side , repeat the above .palpate with your right hand ,placing your left hand behind
    the subjects left lower ribs ,pulling the rib cage forward(Macleod’s) Feel along the left costal margin and percuss over the lateral chest wall to confirm or exclude the presence of splenic dullness SHIFTING DULLNESS (ASCITES) Explain the test procedure
    and make the subject comfortable With the subject supine, precuss from the midline out to the flanks and note any change from resonant to dull , along with the areas of dullness and resonance Keep your finger on the site of dullness in the flank and
    ask the subject to turn on his opposite side, pause for at least 10sec to allow any ascites to gravitate then percuss again if the area of dullness is now resonant shifting dullness is present indicating ascites FLUID THRILL Explain the test procedure
    and make the subject comfortable 62 If the abdomen is tensely distended and you are not certain whether ascites is present look for the presences of a fluid thrill. Place the palm of your left hand flat against the left side of the abdomen and flick
    a finger of your right hand against the right side of the abdomen If you feel a ripple against your left hand ask an assistant to place the edge of their hand on the midline of the abdomen This prevents transmission of the impulse via the skin rather
    than through ascites . if you still feel a ripple against your left hand a fluid thrill is present (only detected in gross ascited) ASCULTATION OF ABDOMEN Make the subject comfortable and explain the test procedure With the subject lying on his back
    place the stethoscope diaphragm to the right of the umbilicus and do not move it , bowel sounds are gurgling noises from normal peristaltic activity of the gut .They normally occur every 5-10 sec , but the frequency varies Listen for up to 2 mins
    before concluding that bowel sounds are absent Listen over umbilicus over aorta for arterial bruits(Macleod’s) Now place the stethoscope 2-3 cm above and lateral to the umbilicus and listen for renal artery bruits Listen over the liver for bruits
    from hepatoma , a friction rub which sounds like rubbing of dry fingers together may be heard over liver or spleen A succession splash sounds like half filled water bottle being shaken. For this shake the abdomen by lifting him with both hands under
    the pelvis , an audible splash more than 4 hours after eating food or drinking indicates delayed gastric emptying. References Hutchison. An integrated approach to clinical medicine.22ndedition; 2009. Macleod. Clinical Examination.13thedition; 2013.
