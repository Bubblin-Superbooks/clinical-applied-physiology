**Problem Based Learning**

**Central Nervous System**

**Case No 1**

A 60 year old man walked into the Neurology Clinic and the physician paid particular

attention to his gait. The patient raised his feet unnecessarily high and brought them

to the ground in a stamping manner. On questioning, the patient said that he was


finding it increasingly difficult to walk and was starting to use a stick, especially when

he went out for walks in the dark. The physician asked the patient to stand with his

toes and heels together and close his eyes. The patient immediately started to sway.

On further examination, the patient was found to have loss of muscle-joint sense of

both legs and was unable to detect any feeling of vibration when a vibrating tuning

fork was placed on the medial malleolus of either of legs. No other sensory or motor

losses were noticed.

**Questions:**

1. What is the site of lesion?
2. Which sensations are carried by the concerned sensory tract?
3. Name the test the doctor performed?

**Answers**

1. The site of lesion – fibers of dorsal column is the fasciculus gracilus and
fasciculus cuneatus is effected by Tabes dorsalis. It is a neurological symptom
of tertiary syphilis that affects degeneration of dorsal nerve root.
2. Sensations carried by the dorsal tract can be memorized by the
pneumonic PSVT
Propioception
Somatic localization (two point discrimination)
Vibration
Touch (fine)


3. Rhomberg’s sign is positive in the patient of Tabes dorsalis. This is a
sign of sensory ataxia. On removing the visual cues the person falls. In
cerebellar ataxia whether eyes are open or closed the person falls.

**Case No 2**

A 21 year old soldier returned from the war after receiving a gunshot wound in his

spinal column. On examination, you note that he has weakness of left lower

extremity. In addition he has loss of pain and temperature perception on the right side

from about the level of his navel downward, vibration joint position sense and

discriminatory function are reduced in the left leg touch is normal.

**Questions**

1. What is the anatomico pathological diagnosis?
2. What is the name given to this type of syndrome?
3. Why was the sensation of touch preserved in this patient?

```
Answers
```
1. Lesion in left side of the spinal cord at T
2. Brown Sequard Syndrome or Hemisection of spinal cord
3. Left side touch is preserved because anterior-spinothalamic carrying
touch on left side crosses to right side.
Right side touch is preserved because posterior column (dorsal column)
carries touch which is preserved.

**Case No 3**

A 46 year old man had progressive weakness in all the four limbs, for 8 weeks. He

also had difficulty in taking food. His speech is slurred. Examination of motor system

revealed


```
a) Power grade III in all four limbs
b) Deep reflexes are sluggish
c) Hypotonia
d) Twitching of muscle was present
e) Plantar reflex-flexor bilaterally
```
**Questions**

1. What type of lesion the man is suffering from Upper motor neuron
Lesion (UMNL) or Lower motor neuron Lesion ( LMNL)?
2. Why do you think so?
3. Which condition can lead to this type of disorder?
1. Lower motor Neuron Lesion ( LMNL)
2. There is hypotonia, weakness of muscles, reflexes are sluggish.
Plantar reflex is flexor bilaterally or down going i.e. Babinski’s sign is negative.
These are signs of ( LMNL)
3. Cisternal Puncture
Poliomyelitis
Demyelinating disease

```
Case No 4
```

```
Mr. A Gurung is a 70 year old male who fell in the bathroom one morning. He
was found to lie on the floor, awake and alert, but was unable to move his right
arm and leg. He has been hypertensive (220/110 mm of Hg) but well
controlled with medication (150/90 mm of Hg). He states that recently he has
had some minimal difficulty maintaining his balance.
```
```
Neurological Examination
```
```
Motor system - Nearly complete paralysis of right arm, right leg could be
elevated only slightly. Strength on the left side seemed normal and left leg
could be raised about 45 degrees. Few flickers of motion were noticed in the
biceps and triceps.
Reflexes- Monosynaptic reflexes (MSRs) are brisk (+) from the right biceps,
triceps, quadriceps and gastrocnemius. MSRs are normal on the left.
Babinski’s sign is positive on the right side.
```
```
Questions
```
1. What type of lesion the man is suffering from UMNL/LMNL?
2. Why do you think so?
3. What is the possible site of lesion?
4. What might be the cause?
1. Upper Motor Neuron Lesion (UMNL)
2. Babinski’s sign is positive
    Exaggeration of reflexes
3. The site of lesion is in the left side of Internal capsule
4. Thrombosis/ Ischemia/Atherosclerosis of lenticulo-striate branch of
Middle cerebral artery

```
Upper motor neuron (UMN) Paralysis Lower motor neuron (LMN) Paralysis
```
1. The neuron from the brain to anterior

horn cell are lesioned e.g. pyramidal tract

1. The spinal or cranial nerves are
lesioned
2. Hypertonic or Spastic paralysis due to

release of inhibitory higher control

2. Flaccid paralysis
3. No atrophy 3. Disuse atrophy
4. Brisk hyperactive reflexes due to

increase in gamma motor discharge

4. Absence of reflexes
1. Babinski’s sign positive 5. Babinski’s sign not elicited


Stoking the outer edges of the sole of the

foot with firm tactile stimulus produces

first an upward movement i.e.

dorsiflexion of the great toe and fanning

out abduction of the small toes. This is

due to contraction of extensor hallucis

longus. This is flexor withdrawal

response.

It will remain positive through out the life

if once positive. He can neither run fast

nor travel long distances.

Causes

1. Deep sleep
2. Infants below one year of age
3. Pyramidal tract lesions
4. Cheynes Stokes respiration due to

Case No 5
```
```
A 37 year old man visited his physician because he had noticed clumsiness of his
right arm. The symptoms had started six months previously and were getting worse.
He also noticed that his right arm. The symptoms had started six months previously
and were getting worse. He also noticed that his right hand had a tremor when he
attempted fine movements or tried to insert a key into the lock. When he walked he
noticed that now and again he tended to reel to the right and had a staggering gait.
```
```
Neurological examination revealed
```
```
a) When asked to touch his nose with his right index finger, the right hand
displayed tremor and the finger tended to overshoot the target.
b) Hypotonia of muscles
```
```
Questions
```

1. Which part of the nervous system is affected?
2. Explain the cause of signs and symptoms of this disease?
**Answers**
1. Cerebellum (right cerebellar lobe- as there is double crossing of fibers

and cerebellar lesion affects the same side)

2. **Hypotonia** because of loss of facilitatory effect of neocerebellum
**Intentional tremors** are seen when fine movements are attempted because

of alternate contractions of agonistic and antagonistic muscles. Cerebellum

helps in making movement smooth , coordinated and accurate in rate, range

and force. In cerebellar disease an entire movement can’t be directed by a

single motor command.
**Stagggering gait** as subject face difficulty in maintaining balance, he moves in

a zigzag fashion, has a tendency to fall on the same side as the affected side

of lesion
**Dysmetria.** Cerebellum is needed for execution of activity, due to dysmetria

there is loss of target perception.
**Past pointing**


```
Rebound phenomenon
```
**Case No 6**

A 65 year old man presented in the medicine OPD with complaints of tremor. He has

a stooped posture, festinating gait and loss of associated movements, masked face

and slurred voice. On examination muscle tone showed cogwheel rigidity

**Questions:**

1. Name the disease the patient is suffering from?
2. What are the sites of lesion?
3. Mention the changes in the neurotransmitter in this disease.

```
Answers
```
1. Parkinson disease
2. Basal ganglia
3. Decrease in Dopamine/ Increase in Acetylcholine
4. Reduction in choline acetyl transferase in nucleus basalis



**Case No 7**

A 68 years old man was brought to a neurology clinic with symptoms of tremors of

hand. He suffered from profound weakness of muscles, gets easily fatigued, more so

in the evening. It was noticed that his eyelids were drooping and the infrequently

blinked his eyes. The patient tended to speak in a low, faint voice.

**Questions**

1. What do you think is the possible diagnosis?
2. What is the cause and mention the changes in neurotransmitters.
3. How it can be treated?

**Answers**

**1.** Myasthenia gravis
**2.** Formation of circulating antibodies to nicotine Acetylcholine receptors
(Nm). It is a rare but autoimmune disease. Neurotransmitter acetylcholine is
destroyed in synaptic cleft by acetylcholinesterase. This produces a miniature
end plate potential (MEPP). The subject suffers from profound weakness of
muscles and he gets fatigued easily
**3.** It can be treated by administration of Neostigmine or other effective
anticholinesterase inhibitors that help increase concentration of acetycholine in
the cleft by preventing its destruction.


**Case No 8**

A 25 year old man awake one morning and noted that the left side of his face

seemed weak. On looking into a mirror he noted that he could not retract the

left corner of his mouth as well as the right. He also noted that he could no

longer close his left eye completely or smiles with the left side of his face.

Neurological examination revealed no abnormality except for the following:

a) At rest the left side of the face dropped and the left palpebral fissure

was wider than the right
b) The left side of his forehead did not wrinkle when he tried raising his

eyebrows
c) When he attempted to show his teeth his mouth pulled to the right
d) Results of testing for sensations of pain, temperature and touch of the

face were normal
e) Taste was absent on the left side of the tongue
f) Strips of filter paper were placed in the conjuctival sac, the one on the

right became moist within a few minutes and the left side remained dry.

```
Questions
```
1. What is the location of the lesion?
2. Why was taste involved?
3. Why was their decreased lacrimation?
4. What is the name of this clinical entity?

```
Answers
```
1. Genu of facial nerve
2. Taste is involved because branch of facial nerve is cut that conveys

taste sensation from anterior 2/3 rd of tongue

3. Lacrimation is decreased because of damage to greater petrosal nerve
4. Bell’s palsy


**Case No 9**

A 40 year old man has come to a STD clinic with sign and symptoms of tertiary

syphilis

Examination revealed:

```
a) His pupils are small and fixed bilaterally
b) Light reflex is lost bilaterally
c) Accommodation reflex is intact bilaterally
```

**Questions**

1. What is the name of this condition?
2. What is the site of lesion?
3. Explain why the accommodation reflex is intact and light reflex is lost?

**Answers**

1. ARP -Argyll Robertson pupil (ARP-Accomodation Reflex Present, Light
reflex absent )
2. Pretectal nucleus of midbrain
3.

Pathway of Light reflex

Light information

Optic nerve

Optic tract

Superior colliculi or Pretectal nucleus

_Via colliculonuclear fibers_

III nerve, ciliaryganglia , sphincter pupillae

The accommodation reflex

When an individual looks at a near object the following are manifested:

1) Contraction of ciliary muscle via III nerve, as a result anterior curvature of lens increases.

2) Constriction of pupil due to contraction of sphincter pupillae

3) Convergence of visual axis due to contraction of medial rectus muscle


Pathway of Accommodation Reflex

Visual information

_Via visual pathway_

Primary visual area of cortex, area 17

Frontal eye fields, area 8

_Via corticonuclear fibers_

III rd nerve, EdingerWestphal nucleus

Ciliary muscles, sphincter pupillae and medial rectus

Note to remember _corticonuclear and colliculonuclear_. Accomodation reflex comes from

relay in cortex ( _corticonunclear_ ), is involved in reading. The light reflex involves the

midbrain ( _colliculonuclear_ ). The accomodation involves the conciousness and is absent in

lower animals. A dog has light reflex but cannot read!

**Problem Based Learning : Endocrine System**


**Case No 1**

A 30 year old woman noted the onset of amenorrhea one year ago. In the past 6

months she noted that she became tired very easily; could not tolerate stress and

cold weather, she had also lost weight. Physical examination revealed a dull

apathetic thin woman with low blood pressure, slow pulse rate.

```
a) What is the site of primary lesion?
b) What structures are affected by the lesion?
c) Which hormones are affected in this patient?
```
**Answer**

```
a) Anterior pituitary
b) Thyroid gland, adrenal cortex, ovaries
```

c) i) Gonadotropic hormones (FSH, LH)-deficiency causes amenorrhea
ii) Lack of TSH- hence patient becomes tired, loss of weight is observed,

cannot tolerate cold weather, decrease in blood pressure and slow pulse rate
iii) Lack of ACTH-there is intolerance of stress

A 40 year old man noticed a frequent need to increase the size of his shoe for
the past four months. His friends also told him about the changes in his facial
features. His forehead is slanted forward and lower jaw is protruding forward
and tongue enlarged. X-ray of his ankle and wrist showed an increase in soft
tissue thickness. Biochemical test showed an increase in fasting blood sugar
level.
```
```
Questions
```
1. What is the endocrine disorder the man is suffering from?
2. What might be the cause of this disorder?
3. Why is there an increase in the fasting blood sugar level?

Answers

1. Acromegaly : due to excessive secretion of growth hormones after the
fusion of epiphysis
2. i) Pituitary tumor-release of excess of Growth hormone (GH)
    ii) Functional tumour of hypothalamus-causes release of GHRH (growth
    releasing hormone)
    iii) Hypothalamic lesion
3. Growth hormone is a diabetogenic hormone. It decreases peripheral
uptake of glucose. Hence fasting blood sugar levels increase in acromegaly.


Case no. 3

A 45 year old woman presented with the complaints of easy fatigability and lack of

appetite for past one month. On examination it was found that her skin is dry,

thickened, and yellowish with a puffy face and course hair. She also complained of

recent loss of her eyebrow. Her voice was husky. Neurological examination showed

delayed reflexes. Biochemical examination showed high blood cholesterol level.

**Questions**

1. What endocrine disorders the patient is suffering from?


2. Why her voice is husky and the skin is dry and thickened?
3. What might be the probable causes of this disorder?

**Answers**

1. Myxoedema (hypothyroidism)
2. Due to laryngeal oedema which also causes recurrent laryngeal nerve
compression, the voice becomes husky
Accumulation of Hyaluronic acid/ chondroitin sulphate beneath the skin makes
it dry and thickened
3. A) Iodine deficiency- Endemic goiter
B) Hashimoto’sthyroiditis
C) Thyroidectomy
D) Any radiation injury
E) Pituitary or Hypothalamic failure (Decrease in TSH or decrease in TRH)


**Case No. 4**


A 30 year old woman complained of excessive sweating, increased appetite

and loss of weight for past one month. On examination she had tachycardia

with high systolic blood pressure. Her thyroid gland showed diffuse

symmetrical enlargement. She had exophthalmos with fine tremors in her

outstretched fingers. Biochemical test showed increased plasma T3 and T4

and slight decrease in plasma TSH level

Questions:

1. What is the probable diagnosis?
2. Why this patient had exophthalmos?
3. Why are there as increase plasma T3 and T4 level and a slight

decrease in plasma TSH level?

```
Answers
```
1. Hyperthyroidism (Peri-graves disease)
2. Due to accumulation of chondroitin sulphate and hyaluronic acid in

extra-ocular muscles of eye, accumulation of water occurs and eyes bulge,

leading to **proptosis** and an increase in vertical diameter in which sclera is

visible over the iris **(Exopthalmos)**

3. Hyperfunctioning of thyroid gland causes increase in T3 and T4 levels;

These have negative feedback at level of pituitary thereby _decreasing levels of_

TSH - **primary hyperthyroidism**. In **secondary hyperthyroidism** the _TSH_

_levels are high_ because of a tumor of pituitary, that causes hyperthyroidism.
Serum TSH levels are used to differentiate between primary and
secondary hyperthyroidism


**Case No 5**

A 35 year old lady complaint of weakness, fatigue and weight loss for past one

month. On examination, BP of 82/58 mm of Hg. Hyperpigmented areas are seen on

her palm and buccal mucosae. On examination the patient was found to have

bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and high serum calcium level. Lymph node biopsy

showed non- caseating granulomas.

Questions:

1. What is the probable diagnosis?
2. Why is the patient having hyperpigmentation?
3. Why is her BP low?

**Answers**


1. Addison’s disease
2. Due to decrease in aldosterone and glucocorticoids, there is an
Increase in ACTH due to decrease in negative feedback. ACTH has β MSH
like activity that causes hyperpigmentation.
POMC is Pre-Opio-Melano-Cortin that breaks down to opiod, melanin(MSH)
and cortin for providing ACTH. Melanin stimulating hormone causes the
hyperpigmentation.
3. Lack of aldosterone, leads to decrease renal tubular sodium
reabsorption, consequently loss of sodium, chloride and water occurs in urine.
The ECF volume decreases and that’s why her Blood pressure is low

**Case No 6**

A 35 year old has undergone radical thyroidectomy for papillary carcinoma of thyroid

gland. Her recovery was uneventful till the second postoperative day, when suddenly

she developed seizures and her voice was choked. The doctors on duty could

demonstrate carpopedal spasm. The patient recovered only after an i.v injection of

calcium gluconate.


**Questions**

1. What was the problem in this case?
2. What are biochemical tests done to confirm the diagnosis?
3. Why does the patient develop seizures and carpopedal spasm?

**Answers**

1. During radical thyroidectomy, parathyroid gland has also been
removed. This leads to decrease in Parathormone and decrease in calcium.
2. Serum Calcium level (normal 9-11mg%)
Other tests are-
 Chvostek’s sign: Facial tics on tapping facial nerve at pre-auricular area
 Trousseau’s sign: Carpopedal spasm (Figure 6) on tying BP cuff at 100
mm Hg
 Erb’s sign: Policeman tip hand
 Laryngeal stridor: Life threatening condition , may require tracheostomy
3. The patient develops seizures and carpopedal spasm because of
Hypokalemia. Calcium has a stabilizing effect on cell membrane of excitable
tissue. Hypocalcemia exerts a net excitatory effect on nerve cell and muscles.


**Case No 7**

A 50 year old man presented with complaints of polyuria, polydipsia and loss of

weight in spite of increased appetite for past two months. Biochemical examination

showed high fasting and postprandial blood sugar level.

**Questions**

1. What is the probable diagnosis?
2. What are the causes?
3. What are the complications in this type of disease?

**Answer**

1. Diabetes mellitus (Type I)
2. Causes are those that damage β cell which are


```
 Autoimmunity
 Viral infection
 Genetic factors
```
3. Complications are-
 Atheroscleosis
 Microangiopathy
 Diabetes nephropathy
 Ketoacidosis
 Neuropathy
 Retinopathy

**Case No 8**

A 6 year old boy has no testicle present in the right side of his scrotum. On careful

palpation a deep firm ovoid structure could be felt above the medial part of the

inguinal ligament.

**Questions**

1. What is the probable diagnosis?
2. What causes descent of testes?
3. What is the effect of undescended testis?
4. What is the benefit of descent of testes to scrotum?

**Answer**

1. Cryptorchidism
2. a) Gubernaculum
b) MIS (Mullerian inhibitory substance)
c) Testosterone
3. The descent of testes is necessary for normal spermatogenesis.
Therefore effect of undescended testes is sterility.
4. Benefit of descent of testis to scrotum-
There is air circulation in scrotum. Hence temperature of testes is maintained
or little less than body temperature
Counter current blood flow causes
 Maintenance of concentration of testosterone
 Temperature regulation


**Case No 9**

A 25 year old lady was brought by her husband to the OPD with complaints of

dizziness, nausea and vomiting. She gave a history of having missed her last

menstrual period. On examination her BP was 130/90 mm Hg. Rest of the systems

were normal.

**Questions**

1. What is your probable diagnosis?
2. What are the tests to be done to confirm the diagnosis?


3. Why she missed her last menstrual period?
4. What is the role of ovary at this time?

```
Answers
```
1. Woman is pregnant
2. HCG in urine
3. Syncytiotrophoblast in developing zygote secretes HCG which
maintains corpus luteum and prevents its degeneration. Hence high levels of
progesterone are secreted from corpus luteum.
Menstruation proper or break through bleeding occurs due to fall in levels of
progesterone and estrogen.
4. Ovary becomes corpus luteum which maintains high estrogen and
progestrone level for maintenance of pregnancy.

**Case No 10**

A married woman living with her husband reports to the doctor for amenorrhea on

May 20, 2002. She had her last menstrual period beginning April 1 2002 and ending

April 4, 2002. She reports of regular 30 day cycle.

**Questions**

1. What is the first impression of the doctor?
2. Which day do you think the woman has ovulated?
3. Which test the doctor shall recommend for his/her diagnosis to be
confirmed?
4. What is the physiological basis of the test?

```
Answer
```
1. Woman is pregnant
2. April 16, 2002
3. Presence of HCG in urine proves diagnosis
4. Antigen-Antibody reaction (Agglutination)
Antibodies are produced against HCG in rabbit. Sheep RBC’s are labeled with
HCG
These two and urine from woman are mixed.


If agglutination does not occur, there is no pregnancy
But if agglutination occurs woman is pregnant.

_through the mouth. feel for the edge as it descends on inspiration_

_4. Move your hand progressively up the abdomen 1cm at a time between_

_each breathe until you reach the costal margin or detect the liver edge_

_5. If you feel the liver edge liver may be enlarged or displaced downwards by_

_hyper inflated lungs_

_6. If you feel the liver edge then describe its size , surface , edge ,_

_consistency , tenderness , whether pulsatile or any bruit heard_

```
EXAMINATION OF SPLEEN
```
_1. Explain the test procedure and make the subject comfortable
2. Start from the umbilicus and by keeping your hand stationary ask the_

_subject to breathe deeply through mouth feel for the splenic edge as it descends_

_on inspiration_

_3. Move your hand diagonally upwards towards the left hypochondrium 1cm_

_at a time between each breathe._

```
SHIFTING DULLNESS (ASCITES)
```
_1. Explain the test procedure and make the subject comfortable
2. With the subject supine, precuss from the midline out to the flanks and_

_note any change from resonant to dull , along with the areas of dullness and_

_resonance_

_3. Keep your finger on the site of dullness in the flank and ask the subject to_

_turn on his opposite side, pause for at least 10sec to allow any ascites to_

_gravitate then percuss again if the area of dullness is now resonant shifting_

_dullness is present indicating ascites_

```
FLUID THRILL
```
_1. Explain the test procedure and make the subject comfortable_


_2. If the abdomen is tensely distended and you are not certain whether
ascites is present look for the presences of a fluid thrill.

detected in gross ascited)_

```
ASCULTATION OF ABDOMEN
```
_1. Make the subject comfortable and explain the test procedure

right of the umbilicus and do not move it , bowel sounds are gurgling noises from
normal peristaltic activity of the gut .They normally occur every 5-10 sec , but the
frequency varies
3. Listen for up to 2 mins before concluding that bowel sounds are absent
4. Listen over umbilicus over aorta for arterial bruits(Macleod’s)
5. Now place the stethoscope 2-3 cm above and lateral to the umbilicus and
listen for renal artery bruits
6. Listen over the liver for bruits from hepatoma , a friction rub which sounds
like rubbing of dry fingers together may be heard over liver or spleen
7. A succession splash sounds like half filled water bottle being shaken. For
this shake the abdomen by lifting him with both hands under the pelvis , an
audible splash more than 4 hours after eating food or drinking indicates delayed
gastric emptying._
