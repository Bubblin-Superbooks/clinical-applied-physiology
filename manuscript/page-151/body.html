		<h6>The ECG recording obtained is analyzed as follows: </h6>
		<ol>
			<li>Rate – 1500/R-R in interval gives the heart rate.</li>
			<li>Rhythm – Look at the rhythm strip (long duration recording obtained from lead 2) and check for a constant PR interval.</li>
			<li>Sequence – Ensure that the ECG waves follow the sequential pattern of P wave appearing first, followed by the QRS complex and finally T wave, before the next P wave appears.</li>
			<li>Axis – Calculate the axis of the heart. Normal cardiac axis ranges from -30 degrees to +110 degrees. If the axis is less than -30 degrees, it is considered as left axis deviation and if the axis is greater than +110 degrees, it is considered right axis deviation.</li>
