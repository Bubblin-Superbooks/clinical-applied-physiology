					<h4>BLOOD PRESSURE </h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Check the zero reading on the mercury manometer</li>
						<li>Rest the patient for 5 mins</li>
						<li>Use either arm unless one arm is known to record a higher pressure. If that is the case use the arm that shows higher pressure.</li>
						<li>With the patient seated/lying down support his arm comfortably at about heart level ensuring no tight clothing constricts the upper arm, you can measure over thin clothing as it makes no difference to the result</li>
						<li>Wrap un-inflated cuff of sphygmomanometer firmly around the bear upper arm 2.5-5 cm above the elbow joint.</li>
						<li> Palpate the brachial pulse</li>
						<li>Inflate the cuff until the pulse is impalpable note the pressure on the manometer this is a rough estimate of systolic pressure (palpatory method)</li>
						<li>Inflate the cuff another 30mmHg and listen through the diaphragm of the stethoscope placed over the brachial artery</li>
