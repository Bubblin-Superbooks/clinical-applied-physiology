			<li>Identify the timing and form of pulsation and note any abnormality</li>
		</ol>

		<h4>BLOOD PRESSURE </h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Check the zero reading on the mercury manometer</li>
			<li>Rest the patient for 5 mins</li>
			<li>Use either arm unless one arm is known to record a higher pressure. If that is the case use the arm that shows
				higher pressure.</li>
			<li>With the patient seated/lying down support his arm comfortably at about heart level ensuring no tight clothing
				constricts the upper arm, you can measure over thin clothing as it makes no difference to the result</li>
			<li>Wrap un-inflated cuff of sphygmomanometer firmly around the bear upper arm 2.5-5 cm above the elbow joint.
			</li>
			<li> Palpate the brachial pulse</li>
			<li>Inflate the cuff until the pulse is impalpable note the pressure on the manometer this is a rough estimate of
				systolic pressure (palpatory method)</li>
			<li>Inflate the cuff another 30mmHg and listen through the diaphragm of the stethoscope placed over the brachial
				artery</li>
		</ol>

		<li> Deflate the cuff slowly (2-3mmHg) until you hear a regular tapping sound (phase I Krotokoff sound).</li>
		<li> Record the reading to the nearest 2mmHg. This is the systolic pressure </li>
		<li> Continue to deflate the cuff slowly until the sounds disappear</li>
		<li>Record the pressure at which the sounds completely disappear as the diastolic pressure (phaseV). Occasionally
			muffled sounds persist (phase IV) and do not disappear in which case the point of muffling is best guide to the
			diastolic pressure</li>
		</ol>
		<h4> PERCUSSION OF BORDERâ€™S OF HEART</h4>
		<h6> LEFT BORDER</h6>
		<ol>
			<li>Stand on the right side of the subject and explain the test procedure.
			</li>
			<li>Subject is percussed in the 4th and 5th ICS (inter costal space) in the mid-axillary region and then medially
				towards the left border of the heart</li>
			<li>Resonant note of lung becomes dull. Normally it is along the apex beat.</li>
