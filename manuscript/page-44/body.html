	<strong> Pathway of Accommodation Reflex: </strong>
	<p class="no-indent">Visual information (via visual pathway) → Primary visual area of cortex, area 17 → Frontal eye fields, area 8 (via corticonuclear fibers) → III<sup>rd</sup> nerve, EdingerWestphal nucleus → Ciliary muscles, sphincter pupillae and medial rectus </p>

		👉🏻 A note to remember about <em> corticonuclear</em> and <em>colliculonuclear</em>. Accomodation reflex comes from relay in cortex (<em>corticonunclear</em>), is involved in reading. The light reflex involves the midbrain (<em>colliculonuclear</em>).
        The accomodation involves the conciousness and is absent in lower animals. A dog has light reflex but cannot read!</p>
