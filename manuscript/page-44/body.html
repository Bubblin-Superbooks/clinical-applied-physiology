On examination she had tachycardia with high systolic blood pressure. Her thyroid gland showed diffuse symmetrical enlargement. She had
    exophthalmos with fine tremors in her outstretched fingers. Biochemical test showed increased plasma T3 and T4 and slight decrease in plasma TSH level Questions: What is the probable diagnosis? Why this patient had exophthalmos? Why are there as increase
    plasma T3 and T4 level and a slight decrease in plasma TSH level? Answers Hyperthyroidism (Peri-graves disease) Due to accumulation of chondroitin sulphate and hyaluronic acid in extra-ocular muscles of eye, accumulation of water occurs and eyes bulge,
    leading toproptosis and an increase in vertical diameter in which sclera is visible over the iris (Exopthalmos) Hyperfunctioning of thyroid gland causes increase in T3 and T4 levels; These have negative feedback at level of pituitary thereby decreasing
    levels of TSH -primary hyperthyroidism.</p></div> </div>
