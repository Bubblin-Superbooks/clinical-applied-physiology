        <p>A 46 year old man had progressive weakness in all the four limbs, for 8 weeks. He also had difficulty in taking food. His speech is slurred. Examination of motor system revealed:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>a) Power grade III in all four limbs</li>
					<li>b) Deep reflexes are sluggish </li>
					<li>c) Hypotonia</li>
					<li>d) Twitching of muscle was present</li>
					<li>e) Plantar reflex-flexor bilaterally</li>
				</ul>
				<h4> Questions </h4>
				<ol>
					<li>What type of lesion the man is suffering from: Upper motor neuron Lesion (UMNL) or Lower motor neuron Lesion ( LMNL)?</li>
					<li>Why do you think so?</li>
					<li>Which condition can lead to this type of disorder?</li>
				</ol>
        <p>
        	 Lower motor Neuron Lesion ( LMNL) There is hypotonia, weakness of muscles, reflexes are sluggish. Plantar reflex is flexor bilaterally or down going i.e. Babinskiâ€™s sign is negative.
        </p>
        <p>     These are signs
            of ( LMNL) Cisternal Puncture Poliomyelitis Demyelinating disease</p>
