											For vibration place a vibrating 128Hz tuning fork over the sternum and ask the subject “Do you feel it buzzing?”(Macleod’s)
										</li>
										<li>
											Next place it on the tip of the great toe, if sensation is impaired, place the fork on the interphalangeal joint and progress proximally -- medial malleolus, tibial tuberosity and anterior iliac spine--depending upon the response (Macleod’s)</li>
										<li>
											Repeat the process in the upper limb, start at the distal interphalangeal joint of the forefinger and if sensation is impaired proceed proximally—radial styloid, olecranon, acromion (Macleod’s)
										</li>
										<li>
											If in doubt as to the accuracy of the response, ask the subject to close his eyes and to report when you stop the fork vibrating with your fingers (Macleod’s)
										</li>
										<li>
											For <strong>joint position sense</strong> with the subjects eyes open , demonstrate the procedure. Hold the distal phalanx of the subjects great toe at the sides to avoid giving information from pressure and move it up and down (Macleod’s)
