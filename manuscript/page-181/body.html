        High-altitude Pulmonary Edema. Pulmonary vasoconstriction in response to hypoxia is associated by
        hypertension and causes edema. The person suffers from dyspnea. He needs rest, calcium channel blockers, oxygen
        and
        return to lower altitude. This may occur even in acclimatised individuals who exercise and is usually seen in
        unacclimatised individuals. It is also associated with nausea, vomiting, headache and cerebral edema.

        Hyperventilation occurs due to hypoxic hypoxia, which stimulates the peripheral chemoreceptors. The
        concentration of 2,3
        DPG increases, because of increase of pH in the cells.(as deoxyhemoglobin binds more hydrogen ions than
        oxyhemoglobin).
        The person feels lazy, sleepy and may get a headache. These are due to central CNS depression by hypoxia.
