    <p class="no-indent">The lab data can be interpreted as follows: </p>
    <ul class="small">
      <li>Step 1: The pH value is elevatedâ€”implies, Alkalosis.</li>
      <li>Step 2: CO2 content is predominantly affected, it is a case of respiratory alkalosis.</li>
      <li>Step 3: It is chronic respiratory alkalosis.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="squeeze">
      In in chronic cases, for every 10mmHg fall in pCO2, pH rises by 0.03pH units, and HCO3 falls by 5 mmol/L. In this
      case, pCO2 has decreased from 40 to 30 (a change of 10mmHg), pH has increased from 7.45 to 7.48 (a change of
      0.03pH units), and HCO3 has decreased from 24 to 19 (a change of 5mMol/L).
      Therefore, it is a case of <strong>Chronic Compensated Respiratory Alkalosis.</strong>
