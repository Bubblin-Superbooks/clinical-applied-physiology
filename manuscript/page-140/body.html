		<h6>Introduction:</h6>
		<p>
			Electrocardiograph is an instrument that is used to pick up, amplify and record the electrical activity of
			the heart. The instrument is very sensitive. It can pick up very minute changes in potential differences
			which occur in microvolts.</p>
		<p>
			Additionally, it can also record subtle changes in frequencies ranging from as
			small as 50 to 100 Hertz. The recording of the electrical activity of the heart obtained is called
			<em>electrocardiogram</em>. </p>
		<p>  The body with the contained fluids acts as a volume conductor. Therefore, the cardiac
			electrical activity is conducted throughout the body including to the bodyâ€™s surface. By placing electrodes
			on the body surface, we are able to record the cardiac electrical activity. The procedure and technique of
			recording and interpreting the ECG is called Electrocardiography.
