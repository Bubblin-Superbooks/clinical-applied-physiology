<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A 35 year old lady complaint of weakness, fatigue and weight loss for past one month. On examination, BP of 82/58 mm of Hg. Hyperpigmented areas are seen on her palm and buccal mucosae. On examination the patient was found to have bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy
    and high serum calcium level. Lymph node biopsy showed non- caseating granulomas. Questions: What is the probable diagnosis? Why is the patient having hyperpigmentation? Why is her BP low? Answers 26 Addison’s disease Due to decrease in aldosterone
    and glucocorticoids, there is an Increase in ACTH due to decrease in negative feedback. ACTH has β MSH like activity that causes hyperpigmentation. POMC is Pre-Opio-Melano-Cortin that breaks down to opiod, melanin(MSH) and cortin for providing ACTH.
    Melanin stimulating hormone causes the hyperpigmentation. Lack of aldosterone, leads to decrease renal tubular sodium reabsorption, consequently loss of sodium, chloride and water occurs in urine. The ECF volume decreases and that’s why her Blood
    pressure is low</p></div> </div>
