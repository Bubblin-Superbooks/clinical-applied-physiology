    <h6>Rapid Compensatory Mechanisms:</h6>
    <p>Haemorrhage decreases the blood volume, venous return, cardiac output, and the blood pressure. Decrease
      in blood pressure leads to lower baroreceptor activity and higher chemoreceptor activity. This automatic reflex
      increases the amount of sympathetic
      discharge.</p>


    <p>Tachycardia (rapid thready pulse), generalised vasoconstriction, increased secretion, and release of
      catecholamines from
      the adrenal medulla, rapid breathing (rapid shallow breathing).
    </p>

    <p>Renal ischemia produces release of angiotensin II that stimulates thirst, and decrease in urine output (acute
      renal failure). These mechanisms retain water and try to bring the ECF volume back to normal.

    <h6>Long-Term Compensatory Mechanisms:</h6>
    <p class="stretch">Restoration of plasma volume within 12‐72 hours by retention of water by kidneys and the capillary shift mechanism.

    <p>
      Restoration of plasma proteins over a period of 3‐4 days due to increased protein synthesis from the liver.</p>
