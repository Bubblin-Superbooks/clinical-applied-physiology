    <h6>Question:</h6>
    <p>Interpret the lab data and write a diagnosis.</p>

    <h6>Answer:</h6>
    
    <p class="no-indent">The lab data can be interpreted as follows: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Step 1: Look at pH, which is lowered in this case. </li>
      <li>Step 2: Is it respiratory or metabolic; since pCO2 is predominantly affected, it is a case of respiratory acidosis.</li>
      <li>Step 3: Is it acute or chronic; it is a chronic case.</li>
    </ul>
    
   <p class="no-indent squeeze">
    In chronic cases, for every 10mmHg rise in pCO2, the value of pH decreases by 0.03 units and the value of HCO3 increases by 4 mmol/L. 
    In this case, pCO2 has increased from 40-60 (a change of 20mmHg), pH has decreased from 7.4 to 7.34 (a change of 0.06), and HCO3- increased from 24 to 32 (a change of 4x2=8mmol/L).
    Therefore, it is a case of <strong>Chronic Compensated Respiratory Acidosis.</strong>
