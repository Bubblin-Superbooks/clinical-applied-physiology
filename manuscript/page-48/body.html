	<h6> Pathway of Accommodation Reflex: </h6>
	<p>Visual information (via visual pathway) → Primary visual area of cortex, area 17 → Frontal eye fields, area 8 (via corticonuclear fibers) → III<sup>rd</sup> nerve, EdingerWestphal nucleus → Ciliary muscles, sphincter pupillae and medial rectus </p>
	<p>
		Note to remember <em> corticonuclear</em> and <em>colliculonuclear</em>. Accomodation reflex comes from relay in cortex (<em>corticonunclear</em>), is involved in reading. The light reflex involves the midbrain (<em>colliculonuclear</em>).
