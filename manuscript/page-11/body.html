                Sensations carried by the dorsal tract can be memorized by the pneumonic PSVT Propioception Somatic localization (two point discrimination) Vibration Touch (fine).

                Rhomberg’s sign is positive in patients with Tabes dorsalis. This is a sign of sensory ataxia. On removing the visual cues the person falls. In cerebellar ataxia whether eyes are open or closed the person falls.
