    note the pressure on the manometer this is a rough estimate of systolic pressure (palpatory method) Inflate the cuff another 30mmHg and listen through the diaphragm of the stethoscope placed over the brachial artery Deflate the cuff slowly (2-3mmHg)
    until you hear a regular tapping sound (phase I Krotokoff sound).record the reading to the nearest 2mmHg.this is the systolic pressure 10.Continue to deflate the cuff slowly until the sounds disappear Record the pressure at which the sounds completely
    disappear as the diastolic pressure (phaseV).occasionally muffled sounds persist (phase IV) and do not disappear in which case the point of muffling is best guide to the diastolic pressure PERCUSSION OF BORDERâ€™S OF HEART 39 LEFT BORDER Stand on the
