								<p> On examination the patient was found to have bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and high serum calcium level. Lymph node biopsy showed non- caseating granulomas.</p>
								<h4> Questions:</h4>
								<ol>
												<li>What is the probable diagnosis?</li>
												<li>Why is the patient having hyperpigmentation?</li>
												<li>Why is her BP low?</li>
								</ol>
								<h4>Answers:</h4>

								<ol>
												<li>Addison’s disease</li>
												<li>Due to decrease in aldosterone and glucocorticoids, there is an increase in ACTH due to decrease in negative feedback. ACTH has β MSH like activity that causes hyperpigmentation. POMC is Pre-Opio-Melano-Cortin that breaks down to opiod, melanin(MSH) and cortin for providing ACTH.</li>
