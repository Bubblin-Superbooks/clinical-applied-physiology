Calculate the E.C.F. volume and its % of T.B.W. Given the following data: from the following data:
Amount of thiosulphate injected 590mg. 
Plasma concentration of substance at the end of 1 hour  :3 mg/100 cc.
Amount of substance excreted in 1 hour 	=20 mg
Assume 45 liters of T.B.W. as 100%

Using the formula concentration=Amount/ Volume
and Amount = (amount injected- amount excreted)
Volume of ECF =(590-20)/0.03
                            =  570/0.03
                            =19000mL or 19L
Percentage 19/45 X100=42%
    
2. Calculate the I.C.F. Volume from the data: 
a.	Amount of Amino pyrine injected= 430 mg.
	Amount of substance excreted during 30 minutes= 10 mg. 
Conc. Of substance in plasma is 1 mg % 
b. 	Amount of inulin injected 3.2 mg.
Amount of substance excreted during 1 hour			0.2 mg
Conc. Of Inulin is 0.02 mg % in plasma 

Ans: Using the formula concentration=Amount/ Volume
and Amount = (amount injected- amount excreted)
ICF Volume cannot be calculated directly.
TBW volume=  (430-10)/0.01=42L
ECF Volume= (3.2-0.2)/0.02=15L
ICF Volume= TBW-ECF
                    = 42-15= 27L       



Enumerate the different body fluid compartments 

Ans.

Plasma 5%

Interstitial 15%

ICF 40%

ECF = Plasma + Interstitial
Extracellular fluid (ECF)

Intracellular fluid (ICF)

Transcellular fluids e.g. CSF, aqueous humor, synovial fluid

The body water constitutes 60% of body weight (40+15+5%)

Remaining 40% is protein, carbohydrates, fat and minerals.


3. Calculate the Blood volume given the following data: 
Amount of Evanâ€™s Blue injected=5 mg.
Conc. Of dye in the plasma after 20 minutes 0.002 mg/ml.
P.C.V. 	50 % 

Ans 3. Evans Blue dye binds to plasma protein.
Volume of plasma= 5/0.002= 2.5L
Volume of PCV is 50%
Volume of plasma is also 50 %
So the volume of Blood Volume =2.5+2.5L= 5 L
