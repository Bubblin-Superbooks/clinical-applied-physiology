			<li>Explain the test procedure and make the subject comfortable. </li>
			<li>
				For light touches: While subject looks away or closes his eyes, use a wisp of cotton wool and ask the subject to respond to each touch (Macleod’s).
			</li>
			<li>
				Time the stimuli irregularly and make a dabbing rather than a stroking or tickling stimulus (Macleod’s).
			</li>
			<li>
				Compare each side for symmetry.
			</li>
			<li>For superficial pain use a fresh neurological pin e.g neurotip and not the hypodermic needle. Dispose
				after every use (Macleod’s).</li>
			<li>Explain and demonstrate the ability to feel sharp pain. Pinprick at different test points and compare for symmetry
				(Macleod’s).</li>
