    rectus muscle 16 Pathway of Accommodation Reflex Visual information Via visual pathway Primary visual area of cortex, area 17 Frontal eye fields, area 8 Via corticonuclear fibers III rd nerve, EdingerWestphal nucleus Ciliary muscles, sphincter pupillae
    and medial rectus Note to remember corticonuclear and colliculonuclear. Accomodation reflex comes from relay in cortex (corticonunclear), is involved in reading. The light reflex involves the midbrain (colliculonuclear). The accomodation involves
    the conciousness and is absent in lower animals. A dog has light reflex but cannot read! Problem Based Learning : Endocrine System 17</p></div> </div>
