			<li>Map out the boundaries of any area of reduced, absent or increased sensation. </li>
			<li>For deep pain explain the test and ask the subject to report as soon as they feel unconfortable
				(Macleod’s).
			</li>
			<li>Squeeze the muscle bellies e.g. calf, biceps or apply pressure to finger nail or toenail beds.</li>
			<li>Do not apply pressure with an instrument or tool e.g. pen (Macleod’s). </li>
			<li>For temperature sensitivity, touch the subject with a cold metallic object e.g. tuning fork, and ask if
				they felt anything (cold?).</li>
			<li>More sensitive assessment requires tubes of hot and cold water at controlled temperatures. </li>
			<li> For vibration place a vibrating 128Hz tuning fork over the sternum and ask the subject “Do you feel it
				buzzing?”</li>
			<li>
				Next place it on the tip of the great toe, if sensation is impaired, place the fork on the
				interphalangeal joint and progress proximally—medial malleolus, tibial tuberosity and anterior
			</li>
