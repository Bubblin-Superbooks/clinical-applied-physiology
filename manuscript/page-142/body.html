		<h6>Electrodes:</h6>
		<p>
			The standard leads that are used for recording the ECG are unipolar and bipolar leads.
			In a unipolar lead, one of the electrodes is the active electrode or the recording electrode and the other is the
			reference or indifferent electrode. In contrast, in bipolar leads, both electrodes are active.
		</p>
		<p class="squeeze">
			The standard bipolar limb leads are labeled lead I, II and III. Here it is important to remember the Einthovanâ€™s
			triangle. This is an equilateral triangle formed with the heart at the center and the right and left shoulder and
			the lower limb as the vertices of the triangle.
