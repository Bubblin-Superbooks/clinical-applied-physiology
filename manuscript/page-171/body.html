        <strong>Purpura:</strong>
        <p class=" no-indent justify">It is characterized by spontaneous superficial bleeding and accumulation of blood
          below the skin and mucus
          membrane. This is due to deficiency of platelet (Thrombocytopenia or Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura or
          ITP and
          Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura or TTP), lazy platelets or dysfunctional platelets (thrombasthenia).
          Purpura may be palpable, which is <em>vasculative</em> purpura e.g. Henoch Scholein purpura.
