      FXII to FXIIa (activated) occurs when collagen is exposed in the blood vessels (in vivo).
      Or <em>in-vitro</em> when the blood comes in contact with negatively charged blood.

      In-vitro, Factor-XII can be activated by exposing blood plasma to certain artificial surfaces or substances like glass or kaolin. 
      This mimics the physiological process of exposure to damaged blood vessel surfaces during injury.
