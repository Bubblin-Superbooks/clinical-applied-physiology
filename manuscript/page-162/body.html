    <ul class="small">
      <li>Step 1: There is a decrease in the pH value indicating acidosis.</li>
      <li>Step 2: It is respiratory acidosis.</li>
      <li>Step 3: It is an acute case of acidosis.</li>
    </ul>

      For every 10 mmHg increase in pCO2, pH decreases by 0.08 pH unit and HCO3- increases by 6 mmol/L in acute cases].
      In this case, as pCO2 has increased from 40 to 60 {change of 20mmHg} pH decreased from 7.4 to 7.24 {change of
      0.08x2 =0.16 pH units} and HCO3- has slightly increased from 24 to 26 {change by 2mmol/L}. Therefore, it is a case
      of <strong>Acute Respiratory Acidosis</strong>.
