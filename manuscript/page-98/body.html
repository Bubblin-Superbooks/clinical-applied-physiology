					<h4> PERCUSSION OF BORDER’S OF HEART</h4>
					<h6> LEFT BORDER</h6>
					<ol>
						<li>Stand on the right side of the subject and explain the test procedure.
						</li>
						<li>Subject is percussed in the 4th and 5th ICS (inter costal space) in the mid-axillary region and then medially
							towards the left border of the heart</li>
						<li>Resonant note of lung becomes dull. Normally it is along the apex beat.</li>
					</ol>

					<h6>RIGHT BORDER</h6>
					<ol>
						<li>Stand on the right side of the subject and explain the test procedure</li>
						<li>Subject is percussed anteriorly in the midclavicular line on the right side until the liver dullness</li>
						<li>Then percuss one space high from midclavicular line medially to the sternal border</li>
						<li>Normally right border is retrosternal</li>
					</ol>
					<h6>UPPER BORDER</h6>
					<ol>
						<li>Stand on the right side of the subject and explain the test procedure</li>
						<li>Subject is percussed in 2nd and 3rd ICS in parasternal line (b/w midclavicular and lateral sternal line)</li>
						<li>Normally resonant note in 2nd space and dull in 3rd space</li>
					</ol>

								<h4>RESPIRATORY SYSTEM TRACHEAE</h4>
								<ol>
												<li>With the patient looking directly forward, look for any deviations.</li>
												<li>Feel for the tracheae by putting the second and fourth finger’s of the examining hand on each edge of the sternal notch and use the third finger to assess whether the tracheae is central/deviated to one side.</li>
												<li>Avoid heavy handedness in this situation it is uncomfortable for the patient if the examiner is rough</li>
												<li>A slight deviation of tracheae to the right may be found even in healthy people.</li>
								</ol>
								<h4>EXPANSION OF CHEST</h4>
								<ol>
												<li>Explain the procedure and relax the subject</li>
												<li>Assess expansion of the upper lobes by observing the clavicle from behind during tidal breathing</li>
												<li>To assess the expansion of the lower lobes place your hands firmly on the chest wall and extend your finger’s around the sides of the patient’s chest your thumb’s should almost meet in the midline and hover just of the chest, so that they move with respiration</li>
