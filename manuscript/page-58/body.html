			<li>Why are there as increase plasma T3 and T4 level and a slight decrease in plasma TSH level?</li>

		<h6>Answers:</h6>
		<ol start="1" style="--start:1">
			<li>Hyperthyroidism (Peri-graves disease)</li>
			<li>Due to accumulation of chondroitin sulphate and hyaluronic acid in extra-ocular muscles of eye,
				accumulation of water occurs and eyes bulge,leading toproptosis and an increase in vertical diameter in
				which sclera is visible over the iris (Exopthalmos) </li>
			<li>Hyperfunctioning of thyroid gland causes increase in T3 and T4 levels; These have negative feedback at
				level of pituitary thereby decreasing levels of TSH -primary hyperthyroidism.
			</li>
			<li>In secondary hyperthyroidism the TSH levels are high because of a tumor of pituitary, that causes hyperthyroidism. Serum TSH levels are used to differentiate between primary and secondary hyperthyroidism
