    <h6>Answer:</h6>
    <p class="squeeze">        
      Serum CPK and LDH levels are very much increased. Serum AST is increased and serum ALT is within normal limits. Serum total cholesterol and triglycerides levels are high whereas serum HDL cholesterol is low. LDL cholesterol is considered as bad cholesterol and HDL cholesterol is considered as good cholesterol. The above signs and symptoms, increased serum CPK, LDH and AST are strongly suggestive of ‘Myocardial Infarction’.
