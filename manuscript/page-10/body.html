            A sixty year old man walked into the Neurology Clinic and the physician paid particular attention to his gait. The patient raised his feet unnecessarily high and brought them to the ground in a stamping manner. On questioning, the patient said that he
            was finding it increasingly difficult to walk and was starting to use a stick, especially when he went out for walks in the dark. The physician asked the patient to stand with his toes and heels together and close his eyes. The patient immediately
            started to sway.</p>
        <p> On further examination, the patient was found to have loss of muscle-joint sense of both legs and was unable to detect any feeling of vibration when a vibrating tuning fork was placed on the medial malleolus of either of legs. </p>
        <p>No other sensory or motor losses were noticed. </p>
