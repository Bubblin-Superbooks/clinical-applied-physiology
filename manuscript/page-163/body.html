    <h4>Case no. 6</h4>
    <h3>Hemorrhagic Shock.</h3>
    <p class="start-chapter">
      A teenager came to the Emergency and Trauma Center at the AIIMS hospital after a road traffic accident that cut
      their tibial artery. They'd suffered a laceration wound on the left lower leg leading to blood loss of an
      estimated 1.6 liters, i.e., 30 % of the total blood volume.
      An attempt to control bleeding by applying pressure failed. 2 liters of Dextran was administered in the ambulance.
      On further examination, their pulse was measured @130/min, BP @84/61 mm Hg, and the Resp. Rate @24/min.
