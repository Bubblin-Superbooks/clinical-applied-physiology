		<ol start="6" style="--start:6">
			<li>If you feel the liver edge then describe its size, surface, edge, consistency, tenderness, whether pulsatile
				or any bruit heard</li>
		</ol>

		<h6>Examination of spleen:</h6>
		<ol start="1" style="--start:1">
			<li>Explain the test procedure and make the subject comfortable</li>
			<li>Start from the umbilicus and by keeping your hand stationary ask the subject to breathe deeply through mouth
				feel for the splenic edge as it descends on inspiration</li>
			<li>Move your hand diagonally upwards towards the left hypochondrium 1cm at a time between each breathe.</li>
			<li>Feel the costal margin along its length as the position of the spleen tip is variable </li>
			<li>If you cannot feel the splenic edge ask the subject to roll towards you and on to his right side, repeat the
				steps above. Palpate with your right hand, placing your left hand behind the subjects left lower ribs, pulling
				the rib cage forward (Macleod’s)</li>
			<li>Feel along the left costal margin and percuss over the lateral chest wall to confirm or exclude the presence
				of splenic dullness</li>
		</ol>

		<h4>SHIFTING DULLNESS (ASCITES)</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Explain the test procedure and make the subject comfortable</li>
			<li>With the subject supine, precuss from the midline out to the flanks and note any change from resonant to dull,
				along with the areas of dullness and resonance </li>
			<li>Keep your finger on the site of dullness in the flank and ask the subject to turn on his opposite side, pause
				for at least 10sec to allow any ascites to gravitate then percuss again if the area of dullness is now resonant
				shifting dullness is present indicating ascites</li>
		</ol>
		<h4>FLUID THRILL</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Explain the test procedure and make the subject comfortable</li>
			<li>If the abdomen is tensely distended and you are not certain whether ascites is present look for the presences
				of a fluid thrill</li>
		</ol>

		<ol start="3">
			<li>Place the palm of your left hand flat against the left side of the abdomen and flick a finger of your right
				hand against the right side of the abdomen</li>
			<li>If you feel a ripple against your left hand ask an assistant to place the edge of their hand on the midline of
				the abdomen</li>
			<li>This prevents transmission of the impulse via the skin rather than through ascites. If you still feel a ripple
				against your left hand a fluid thrill is present (only detected in gross ascited). </li>
		</ol>
		<h4>ASCULTATION OF ABDOMEN</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Make the subject comfortable and explain the test procedure</li>
			<li>With the subject lying on his back place the stethoscope diaphragm to the right of the umbilicus and do not
				move it, bowel sounds are gurgling noises from normal peristaltic activity of the gut.</li>
			<li>They normally occur every 5-10 sec, but the frequency varies Listen for up to 2 mins before concluding that
				bowel sounds are absent </li>
			<li>Listen over umbilicus over aorta for arterial bruits(Macleod’s)</li>
		</ol>

		<ol start="5">
			<li>Now place the stethoscope 2-3 cm above and lateral to the umbilicus and listen for renal artery bruits</li>
			<li>Listen over the liver for bruits from hepatoma, a friction rub which sounds like rubbing of dry fingers
				together may be heard over liver or spleen</li>
			<li>A succession splash sounds like half filled water bottle being shaken.</li>
