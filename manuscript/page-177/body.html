        Malabsorption Syndrome is when ~50% or more of the small intestines are resected, compromised, or bypassed. The
        absorption of vitamins and nutrients falls, leading to malnutrition and wasting. The defective intestinal
        function in the case of Tropical Sprue is likely due to folic acid deficiency caused by gliadin-induced immune
        response.
        <p>
          Gliadin is present in wheat, rye, barley, and oats. Folic acid deficiency may also be induced by the
          consumption of alcohol, as was observed in this case.
          MS produces deficiency <em>villi</em> in the intestines. Administering Tetracycline and eliminating foods that contain
          gliadin from the diet can restore the villi to normal.
