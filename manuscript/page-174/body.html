        <strong>Mechanism of acid secretion:</strong>
        <p class="no-indent justify">
        In the apical cells of gastric parietal cell there exist H+, K+, ATPase that pumps H+ out of the parietal cells
        in exchange for K.
        H+ is formed from H2CO3 that is formed by hydration of CO2, catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase. HCO3‐ formed by the
        dissociation of H2CO3 is extruded out of the basolateral membrane of parietal cells in exchange for Cl‐.

        <strong>Regulation of acid secretion:</strong>
        <p class="no-indent justify stretch-last-line squeeze">
        Acid secretion is stimulated by Histamine via H2 receptors, by acetylcholine via M3 muscarinic receptors, and
        probably by gastrin via gastrin receptors, in the membrane of parietal cells. Prostaglandins E2 inhibit acid
        secretion by
