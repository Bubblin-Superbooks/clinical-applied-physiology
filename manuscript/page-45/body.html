								<h4> Pathway of Accommodation Reflex </h4>
								<p>Visual information (via visual pathway) → Primary visual area of cortex, area 17 → Frontal eye fields, area 8 (via corticonuclear fibers) → III<sup>rd</sup> nerve, EdingerWestphal nucleus → Ciliary muscles, sphincter pupillae and medial rectus </p>
								<p>
												Note to remember <em> corticonuclear</em> and <em>colliculonuclear</em>. Accomodation reflex comes from relay in cortex (<em>corticonunclear</em>), is involved in reading. The light reflex involves the midbrain (<em>colliculonuclear</em>).
								</p>
								<p>The accomodation involves the conciousness and is absent in lower animals. A dog has light reflex but cannot read!</p>
